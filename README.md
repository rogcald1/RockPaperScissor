# RockPaperScissor

JavaScript project: creating a Rock, Paper, Scissor game.

8/21: The hardest part, creating the script itself. Works from the console so far, so next step would be to add some HTML/CSS components to give it a front page. The alert prompts is good enough so far to show that the game works.

8/24: Adding some validation for the answers received in the prompts. Otherwise, you could input anything and it would skip that round. Put in five attempts to collect a valid value, otherwise it'll move on.
